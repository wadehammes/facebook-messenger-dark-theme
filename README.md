# Facebook Messenger Dark Theme

**This extension creates a dark theme for the new Facebook Messenger web app (messenger.com)**

Due to a cease and desist, and eventual forced removed from the Chrome Web Store, this extension now has to be manually downloaded and installed. I will continue development on it.

To use, visit https://github.com/wadehammes/facebook-messenger-dark-theme/releases/, download latest release and install it via `chrome://extensions` in your browser.

## Submitting PRs

If you would like to submit work to this extension, please fork the repo. All work is done in the `src` directory.
